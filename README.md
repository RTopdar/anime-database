# Anime Database Using Angular



A simple interface made using angular to help you find your favorite anime whenever you want.

One half of the website will show you the list of trending anime according to MyAnimeList, and the other half will allow you to search for your favorite anime.

To know more about the anime, you can click on it to go directly to home page.

The project was done to improve my concepts of angular as I had used different concepts like event handling, ngmodel, services, component routing, etc.
